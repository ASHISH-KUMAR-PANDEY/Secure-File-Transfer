To develop a channel to transfer files securely, using key based encryption methods and comparing the different methods on Linux based OS. The sub-objectives incidental to the main objective are:
•	Use of Asymmetric and Symmetric encryption methods to secure both ends of the communication channel
•	To provide a secure channel for faster transmission of data
•	To build a dependable and encrypted file transfer system between client and server
•	To compare the asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms.
