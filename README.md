# Secure-File-Transfer <img src="https://github.com/NikhilMishra1999/Secure-File-Transfer/blob/master/AES/SS/secure.png" height="200" align="right"> 
We developed a channel to transfer files securely, using key based encryption methods and comparing the different methods on Linux based OS. The sub-objectives incidental to the main objective are:
>	- Use of Asymmetric and Symmetric encryption methods to secure both ends of the communication channel
>	- To provide a secure channel for faster transmission of data
>	- To build a dependable and encrypted file transfer system between client and server
>	- To compare the asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms.

## Technology Used
> - Linux Based OS (Ubuntu | Kali)
> - C 
> - Socket Programming

### RSA ENCRYPTION
> RSA algorithm is a public key encryption technique and is considered as the most secure way of encryption. It was invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in year 1978 and hence name RSA algorithm.
> - The RSA algorithm holds the following features âˆ’
> 1. RSA algorithm is a popular exponentiation in a finite field over integers including prime numbers.
> 2. The integers used by this method are sufficiently large making it difficult to solve.
> 3. There are two sets of keys in this algorithm: private key and public key.

## Limitations
1. It can only encrypt text files.
